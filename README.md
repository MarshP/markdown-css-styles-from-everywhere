## markdown-css-styles-from-everywhere
css files with the main Markdown-available elements in mind, from all over the interwebs. 

These could also be used on any html, and on html generated from other sources like ReST or AsciiDoc, however those files may contain html elements not styled by these css sheets.

## Questions

#### How see examples?
There is a self-contained example for each style - just open the html in a browser.

#### Why?
I was experimenting with styles for documentation and ended up with a pile for reference and example. I will use them at other times.

#### You made these?
Only one, `as-help-best.css` That was my final output after all the learning. The others all belong to others and the content or a web search will get you to the originals. WHere there are authorship notices I have ensured they're kept in place. *I will remove any an author asks me to*.

#### Why embed css in the examples? That defeats the purpose of css.
To make it easy to see the look of the style.

#### More?
If I find them.

#### Content is hitting display edge
That's not a question. Lots seem made for an editor or converter to render in a bigger body or div. Edit a margin or width on the body.
