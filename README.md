css files with main Markdown elements in mind, from all over the interwebs.

## Questions

#### Why?
I was experimenting with styles for documentation and ended up with a pile for reference and example. I will use them at other times.

#### You made these?
Only one, `as-help-best.css` That was my final output after all the learning. The others all belong to others and the content or a web search will get you to the originals. *I will remove any an author asks me to*.

#### Why not embed css in the examples so I don't need the relative structure?
This arrangemnt suited me on an idle evening.

#### More?
If I find them.

#### Content is hitting display edge
That's not a question. Lots seem made for an editor or converter to render in a bigger body or div. Edit a margin or width on the body.

#### Not all have examples
